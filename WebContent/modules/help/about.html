1.	Scope of this Agreement, Definitions<br/>
a.	The following terms and conditions (hereinafter referred to as “terms”) represent the exclusive basis for the legal relationships established between the publishers of the software represented by Dr. Thorsten Rissom, Marienburger Str. 47, 10405 Berlin, Germany (hereinafter referred to as “we” or “us”) and the agreement partners (hereinafter referred to as “users”).<br/>
b.	We offer a software called Unidaplan (hereinafter referred to as “software” or “Unidaplan”) which enables scientific working users or institutions to manage scientific samples.<br/>
c.	Deviating user conditions shall not be recognised, unless we provide express written consent to their validity.<br/>
d.	The software is offered under different license models (see section 7 of these terms), depending on the user. One license model is designed exclusively for use in the non-profit area (such as schools, universities, public research facilities). The other license is relevant for any commercial purpose. "Commercial purpose" in this context is a project of any kind in which motivation and purpose is the direct or indirect economic profit.<br/>
<br/>
2.	Subject of Agreement<br/>
a.	Subject matter of the agreement and these terms is the deployment to the user with Unidaplan. The software will be provided to the user as a download or as a web-based usage. The delivery does not occur on a data disk.<br/>
b.	By using the software, we agree with the user to grant him a license to use the software subject to these terms.<br/>
c.	The user acknowledges that due to various hardware and software configurations we cannot assure an unrestricted use of the software.<br/>
d.	We do not offer any data backup regarding the user’s data (scientific samples). This is the sole responsibility of the user.<br/>
<br/>
3.	Agreement Conclusion<br/>
a.	Images and descriptions of Unidaplan only apply as general clarification. Technical data may be subject to change and we reserve the right to make technical changes within reason.<br/>
b.	A legally binding agreement between us and the user shall be concluded by provision of the software to the user, e.g. per download or by provision of a login.<br/>
<br/>
4.	Prices, Conditions of Payment<br/>
a.	The software is offered free of charge for a non-profit use and therefore suitable for non-profit-organisations (e.g. classroom, campus).<br/> 
b.	Any commercial usage is subject to a charge. The user will be informed about price and payment details beforehand. Price information provided to the user is considered gross, inclusive of statutory value-added tax. Payments shall be due immediately without any deductions.<br/> 
<br/>
5.	Users duties<br/>
a.	The user acknowledges that the software is owned by us and that it is protected by laws governing copyright, trademark, intellectual property rights and all other property rights.<br/>
b.	Personal access data (e.g., user ID, password) and the software key may not be provided to third parties and must be kept in a location that is protected against third-party access. <br/>
c.	We and our agents shall be indemnified against all claims by third parties that are based on the illegal use of the software and the services connected therewith by the user or with his consent, or which arise, in particular, from litigation involving data protection, copyright, or other laws. If the user realizes or can be expected to realize that a violation of this type is about to occur, he shall be obligated to notify us thereof without undue delay.<br/> 
d.	The user is solely responsible for the security and the backup of his data.<br/>
e.	The user may not misuse the software for illegal or unauthorized purposes.<br/> 
f.	The user may not loan, rent, lease or license the Program or any copy.<br/>
<br/>
6.	Third-Party Software (Open Source)<br/>
a.	Unidaplan uses third-party software. Some of it is published under an open-source license.<br/> 
b.	Referring to third-party software, the user may find detailed information in de documentation and the “about”-menu in the software.<br/>
<br/>
7.	License Models, Grant of Rights<br/>
a.	We shall grant the user a non-exclusive right, which cannot be sublicensed, to use the software in accordance with these terms. This does not apply to third-party software Unidaplan is using.<br/>
b.	The transmission of the software, in particular any other copying, distribution and sale thereof (beyond the backup copy), is not permitted. <br/>
c.	The transfer of rights takes place only after full payment of applicable licence fees. Whereas with the free license the rights are granted at the time of usage.<br/>
d.	The user’s licence to use the software automatically terminates if the user fails to comply with any provision of these terms. The license to use the software automatically terminates too, when a commercial user does not pay the running fees for the license subscription.<br/>  
<br/>
8.	Limitation of Liability<br/>
a.	We are in no case liable other than for gross negligence or intentionally caused damage. This does not apply to liability for injury to life and limb, or in the event we have assumed a warranty.<br/>
b.	Liability for breach of a cardinal obligation or an essential obligation is limited to the damage which could have been foreseen.<br/>
c.	The following exclusions and limitations of liability apply with regard to our liability for damage compensation, notwithstanding the other legal claim requirements.<br/>
d.	We assume unlimited liability if the cause of the damage is the result of intent or gross negligence.<br/>
e.	If our liability is excluded or limited, this also applies for personal liability of employees, representatives, agents or assistants.<br/>
<br/>
9.	Warranties<br/>
a.	No warranties of any type or kind shall be deemed to have been given by us in respect of the software and/or the documentation including any terms relating to quality, performance, suitability or fitness for purpose. This includes all software elements from us but all third-party software as well.<br/>
b.	We do not warrant that the software will be entirely free from defects or that the operation of the software will be entirely error-free. <br/>
<br/>
10.	Data Protection<br/>
a.	We process the user's personal data for a specific purpose and pursuant to the statutory provisions of the German Federal Data Protection Act.<br/>
b.	The user has the right to receive information on the personal data that has been saved by us about him/her, free of charge. In addition, the user has the right to amend incorrect data, block and delete his personal data provided this does not contradict any legal storage obligation.<br/>
<br/>
11.	Change of these conditions<br/>
a.	We reserve the right to change or amend these terms with regard to future arrangements at any given time, provided this is deemed necessary and if the User is not put at a disadvantage in a breach of good faith.<br/>
b.	The user will be notified in an appropriate manner in writing of the changes made to the terms. As a general rule, such announcements are usually published by email. <br/>
c.	The User can object to the changes made in the terms within 14 days upon publishing the notification and their receipt by the user. If the user does not object to the changes made in the terms after publication and receipt of the notification of these changes in writing within 14 days and submit his/her objection(s) to us the terms which were changed or amended will be considered legally binding with respect to the user. If the user objects within the set time limit, both parties are entitled to terminate this agreement. Further claims by the User are considered hereby invalid.<br/>
<br/>
12.	Final Clauses<br/>
a.	The place of fulfilment and jurisdiction shall be Berlin, Germany.<br/> 
b.	All disputes arising from the software and these terms shall be instituted at the Berlin District Court.<br/>
c.	The law of the Federal Republic of Germany exclusively applies to all contracts concluded by us based on these terms and to any further kind of claims arising thereof; to the exclusion of provisions pertaining to the UN Convention on contracts for the international sale of goods and to the exclusion of German International Private Law.<br/>
